<h1>
  Zimic + Jest + Node.js
</h2>

This example uses Zimic with [Jest](https://jestjs.io) in a server-side environment. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) is
used in this example, but other runtimes should be similar, such as [Deno](https://deno.com) and [Bun](https://bun.sh).

## Application

The application is a simple [Fastify](https://fastify.dev) server, fetching repositories from the
[GitHub API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest). Any other Node.js framework could be used as well, such as
[express](https://expressjs.com) and [Nest.js](https://nestjs.com).

- Server: [`src/app.ts`](./src/app.ts)

## Testing

An example test suite uses Jest to test the application. Zimic is used to mock the GitHub API and simulate a test case
where the repository is found and another where it is not.

### Zimic

- GitHub interceptor: [`tests/interceptors/github.ts`](./tests/interceptors/github.ts)

### Test

- Test suite: [`tests/example.test.ts`](./tests/example.test.ts)
- Test setup file: [`tests/setup.ts`](./tests/setup.ts)
- Jest configuration: [`jest.config.js`](./jest.config.js)

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> The flag `--experimental-vm-modules`, present in the command `test` in the [`package.json`](./package.json), is
> required by Jest because Zimic uses dynamic imports internally.

## Running

1. Clone this example:

   ```bash
   mkdir zimic
   cd zimic
   git init
   git remote add origin git@github.com:zimicjs/zimic.git
   git sparse-checkout init
   git sparse-checkout set examples/with-jest-node
   git pull origin v0
   cd examples/with-jest-node
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Run the tests:

   ```bash
   pnpm run test
   ```
