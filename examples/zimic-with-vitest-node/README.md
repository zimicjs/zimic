<h1>
  Zimic + Vitest + Node.js
</h1>

This example uses Zimic with [Vitest](https://vitest.dev) in a server-side environment. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) is
used in this example, but other runtimes should be similar, such as [Deno](https://deno.com) and [Bun](https://bun.sh).

## Testing

`@zimic/fetch` is used to make requests to the [GitHub API](https://docs.github.com/rest), whose responses are mocked
with `@zimic/interceptor`.

> [!TIP]
>
> `@zimic/fetch` and `@zimic/interceptor` are not required to be used together. `@zimic/interceptor` is compatible with
> any HTTP client implementation, as `@zimic/fetch` works with any HTTP interceptor library. With that in mind,
> `@zimic/fetch` and `@zimic/interceptor` work best together, providing a seamless and type-safe experience for
> performing HTTP requests in your application and mocking them during development and testing.

### `@zimic/interceptor`
