This module contains commands to generate types from schema sources. This is useful to save development time, avoid
errors and keep your types consistent with specifications, such as [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/specification).

## `zimic typegen openapi`

Generate types from an [OpenAPI 3](https://swagger.io/specification) schema.

```
zimic typegen openapi <input>

Positionals:
  input  The path to a local OpenAPI schema file or an URL to fetch it. Version
         3 is supported as YAML or JSON.                   [string] [required]

Options:
  -o, --output        The path to write the generated types to. If not provided,
                      the types will be written to stdout.              [string]
  -s, --service-name  The name of the service to use in the generated types.
                                                             [string] [required]
  -c, --comments      Whether to include comments in the generated types.
                                                       [boolean] [default: true]
  -p, --prune         Whether to remove unused operations and components from
                      the generated types. This is useful for reducing the size
                      of the output file.              [boolean] [default: true]
  -f, --filter        One or more expressions to filter the types to generate.
                      Filters must follow the format `<method> <path>`, where
                      `<method>` is an HTTP method or `*`, and `<path>` is a
                      literal path or a glob. Filters are case-sensitive
                      regarding paths. For example, `GET /users`, `* /users`,
                      `GET /users/*`, and `GET /users/**/*` are valid filters.
                      Negative filters can be created by prefixing the
                      expression with `!`. For example, `!GET /users` will
                      exclude paths matching `GET /users`. If more than one
                      positive filter is provided, they will be combined with
                      OR, while negative filters will be combined with AND.
                                                                         [array]
  -F, --filter-file   A path to a file containing filter expressions. One
                      expression is expected per line and the format is the same
                      as used in a `--filter` option. Comments are prefixed with
                      `#`. A filter file can be used alongside additional
                      `--filter` expressions.                           [string]
```

You can use this command to generate types from a local OpenAPI file:

```bash
zimic typegen openapi ./schema.yaml \
  --output ./schema.ts \
  --service-name MyService
```

Or an URL to fetch it:

```bash
zimic typegen openapi https://example.com/api/openapi.yaml \
  --output ./schema.ts \
  --service-name MyService
```

Then, you can use the types in your interceptors:

```ts
import { httpInterceptor } from 'zimic/interceptor/http';
import { type MyServiceSchema } from './schema';

const interceptor = httpInterceptor.create<MyServiceSchema>({
  type: 'local',
  baseURL: 'http://localhost:3000',
});
```

Our [OpenAPI typegen example](../../examples/with-openapi-typegen) demonstrates how to use `zimic typegen openapi` to
generate types and use them in your application and interceptors.

### `zimic typegen openapi` comments

By default, descriptions in the OpenAPI schema are included as comments in the generated types. You can omit them using
`--no-comments` or `--comments false`.

```bash
zimic typegen openapi ./schema.yaml \
  --output ./schema.ts \
  --service-name MyService \
  --no-comments
```

### `zimic typegen openapi` pruning

By default, pruning is enabled, meaning that unused types are not generated. If you want all types declared in the
schema to be generated, you can use `--no-prune` or `--prune false`.

```bash
zimic typegen openapi ./schema.yaml \
  --output ./schema.ts \
  --service-name MyService \
  --no-prune
```

### `zimic typegen openapi` filtering

You can also filter a subset of paths to generate types for. Combined with [pruning](#zimic-typegen-openapi-pruning),
this is useful to reduce the size of the output file and only generate the types you need.

```bash
zimic typegen openapi ./schema.yaml \
  --output ./schema.ts \
  --service-name MyService \
  --filter 'GET /users**'
```

When many filters are used, a filter file can be provided, where each line represents a filter expression and comments
are marked with `#`:

`filters.txt`

```
# Include any endpoint starting with /users and having any HTTP method
* /users**

# Include any sub-endpoints of /posts with method GET.
GET /posts/**/*

# Include the endpoints /workspaces with methods GET, POST, or PUT.
GET,POST,PUT /workspaces

# Exclude endpoints to get user notifications
!GET /users/*/notifications/**/*
```

Then, you can use the filter file in the command:

```bash
zimic typegen openapi ./schema.yaml \
  --output ./schema.ts \
  --service-name MyService \
  --filter-file ./filters.txt
```

## Programmatic usage
