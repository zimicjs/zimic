# Introduction

Zimic is a collection of TypeScript-first HTTP integration libraries. It provides type-safe utilities to make, receive,
and mock HTTP requests and responses. Zimic is designed to be lightweight, flexible, and easy to use, with type safety
and inference out of the box.

## Motivation

Integrating with real-world HTTP APIs is common in modern web development, yet keeping clients and servers in sync is
still a challenging task. Developers often have to rely on documentation, code inspection, and experimentation to
manually type the code that interacts with the API.

We have all likely seen code like this:

```ts showLineNumbers
interface GitHubRepository {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  owner: { login: string };
}

const owner = 'zimicjs';
const repository = 'zimic';

const response = await fetch(`https://api.github.com/repos/${owner}/${repository}`);

const repository = (await response.json()) as GitHubRepository;
console.log(repository); // { id: 721827056, name: 'zimic', owner: { ... }, ... }
```

The main issue with this approach is that the code is assuming many things about the structure of the API, and no
validation is checking if these assumptions are correct.

- **Manual types**: the `GitHubRepository` interface is defined manually and can differ from the actual API response.
- **Insufficient validation**: paths and parameters are not validated, so typos or changes in the API will cause runtime
  issues without any type errors during development.
- **Response casting**: the response body is manually cast to `GitHubRepository`, which can be repetitive and
  error-prone.

:::note I<span>n fact, did you catch the bug?</span>

We're not checking the response status, so the data may not be `GitHubRepository` at all, but an error with a totally
different structure!

```ts showLineNumbers
const response = await fetch(`https://api.github.com/repos/${owner}/i-dont-exist`);
console.log(response.status); // 404

const repository = (await response.json()) as GitHubRepository;
console.log(repository); // { "message": "Not Found", "status": "404" } // Oops
```

:::

These issues are aggravated the more complex the API is and the more frequently it changes. The API structure might
become diluted in hundreds of manual types, casts, and hardcoded values scattered across the codebase. This can clearly
become a big maintenance burden and a source of bugs, making it hard to keep the types in sync with the API.

With these problems in mind, Zimic was created to provide a type-safe and ergonomic way to interact with HTTP APIs. One
of the main concepts behind Zimic is the idea of a [centralized schema](/docs/zimic-http/guides/1-http-schemas.md) to
define the structure of your HTTP endpoints. It serves as the source of truth for the structure of the API and can be
[autogenerated](/docs/zimic-http/guides/3-typegen.md).

With Zimic, all requests, paths, parameters, and responses are inferred from the schema and type-checked, so you can
have confidence that your code is communicating with the API correctly, without needing manual casts and checks
everywhere. Because of this, migrating to a new API version can be as simple as updating the centralized schema and
checking which parts of the codebase start reporting type errors. The schema can also type and validate your
[HTTP mocks](/docs/zimic-interceptor/1-index.md), ensuring that your application, your tests, and your network mocks are
fully type-safe and in sync _by default_.

## Features

- :gear: **TypeScript-first**

  Zimic has first-class support for TypeScript, providing type safety, inference, validation, and autocompletion out of
  the box. "Typed by default" is one of the main design principles of Zimic.

- :zap: **Lightweight**

  The Zimic libraries are designed with minimal bundle sizes and few external dependencies, making them perfect for
  client and server-side applications.

- :package: **Developer-friendly**

  We believe that developer experience is key to building great applications. The Zimic API is strives to be as simple
  and intuitive as possible, and we're always looking for ways to improve it.

- :test_tube: **Thoroughly tested**

  Zimic has a comprehensive test suite and high code coverage. Testing is a key part of our development process, and we
  take robustness, reliability, predictability, security, and developer confidence very seriously.

## Projects

Zimic is split into an ecosystem of integrated packages.

### `@zimic/http`

[`@zimic/http`](/docs/zimic-http/1-index.md) is a collection of type-safe utilities to handle HTTP requests and
responses, including headers, search params, and form data.

:::info Status: <span>**Beta** :seedling:</span>

:::

- :star: **HTTP schemas**

  Declare the structure of your HTTP endpoints as a [TypeScript schema](/docs/zimic-http/guides/1-http-schemas.md) and
  use it to type your HTTP requests and responses.

- :bulb: **Type generation**

  [`zimic-http typegen`](/docs/zimic-http/guides/3-typegen.md) can automatically infer the types and generate a
  ready-to-use HTTP schema for you.

- :pushpin: **Type-safe APIs**

  Declare type-safe [`Headers`](/docs/zimic-http/api/2-http-headers.md),
  [`URLSearchParams`](/docs/zimic-http/api/3-http-search-params.md), and
  [`FormData`](/docs/zimic-http/api/4-http-form-data.md) objects, fully compatible with their native counterparts.

- [`@zimic/http` - Guides](/docs/http/guides)

### `@zimic/fetch`

[`@zimic/fetch`](/docs/zimic-fetch/1-index.md) is a minimal (~2 kB minified and gzipped) and type-safe `fetch`-like API
client.

:::info Status: <span>**Beta** :seedling:</span>

:::

- :sparkles: **Type-safe `fetch`**

  Create a type-safe [`fetch`-like](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) API client. Use your
  [`@zimic/http` schema](/docs/zimic-http/guides/1-http-schemas.md) and have your requests and responses fully typed by
  default.

- :zap: **Zero dependencies**

  `@zimic/fetch` has no external dependencies, making it a lightweight and fast alternative to other HTTP clients.

- :muscle: **Developer experience**

  `@zimic/fetch` seeks to be as compatible with the
  [native Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) as possible, while providing an ergonomic
  interface to improve type safety. Define default options to apply to your requests, such as a base URL, headers,
  search parameters, and more. Inspect and modify requests and responses using
  [`onRequest`](/docs/zimic-fetch/api/2-fetch.md#onrequest) and
  [`onResponse`](/docs/zimic-fetch/api/2-fetch.md#onresponse) listeners.

### `@zimic/interceptor`

[`@zimic/interceptor`](/docs/zimic-interceptor/1-index.md) provides a readable and type-safe way to intercept and mock
HTTP requests.

:::info Status: <span>**Beta** :seedling:</span>

:::

- :globe_with_meridians: **HTTP interceptors**

  Use [local](/docs/zimic-interceptor/guides/1-local-interceptors.md) or
  [remote](/docs/zimic-interceptor/guides/2-remote-interceptors.md) interceptors to mock external services and simulate
  success, loading, and error states with ease. Use your
  [`@zimic/http` schema](/docs/zimic-http/guides/1-http-schemas.md) and have your requests and responses fully typed by
  default.

- :link: **Network-level interception**

  `@zimic/interceptor` combines [MSW](https://github.com/mswjs/msw) and
  [interceptor servers](/docs/zimic-interceptor/cli/1-server.md) to handle real HTTP requests. From you application's
  point of view, the mocked responses are indistinguishable from the real ones.

- :bulb: **Readability**

  `@zimic/interceptor` was designed to encourage clarity and readability in your mocks. Have
  [declarative assertions](/docs/zimic-interceptor/guides/7-declarative-assertions.md) to verify that your application
  is making the expected requests.

:::tip TIP: <span>`@zimic/fetch` and `@zimic/interceptor` work best together</span>

`@zimic/fetch` and `@zimic/interceptor` are designed to work together, providing a seamless and type-safe experience for
performing HTTP requests and mocking them during development and testing.

However, it's perfectly possible to use `@zimic/interceptor` with any HTTP client implementation, such as
[axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios). Similarly, `@zimic/fetch` can be used with any interceptor library, like
[msw](https://www.npmjs.com/package/msw).
