## Projects

### `@zimic/http`

:::info Status: <span>**Beta** :seedling:</span>

:::

[`@zimic/http`](/docs/http) is a collection of type-safe utilities to handle HTTP requests and responses, including
headers, search params, and form data.

- :star: **HTTP schemas and typegen**: Declare the structure of your HTTP endpoints as a
  [TypeScript schema](/docs/http/guides/schemas) and use it to type your HTTP requests and responses. If you have an
  [OpenAPI v3](https://swagger.io/specification) declaration, [`zimic-http typegen`](/docs/http/cli/typegen) can
  automatically generate the types of your schema.
- :pushpin: **Type-safe native APIs**: Declare type-safe [`Headers`](/docs/http/api/http-headers),
  [`URLSearchParams`](/docs/http/api/http-search-params), and [`FormData`](/docs/http/api/http-form-data) objects, fully
  compatible with their native counterparts.

- [`@zimic/http` - Guides](/docs/http/guides)

### `@zimic/fetch`

:::info Status: <span>**Beta** :seedling:</span>

:::

[`@zimic/fetch`](/docs/fetch) is a minimal (~2 kB minified and gzipped), zero-dependency, and type-safe `fetch`-like API
client.

- :sparkles: **Type-safe `fetch`**: Create a type-safe
  [`fetch`-like](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) API client. Use your
  [`@zimic/http` schema](/docs/http/guides/schemas) and have your requests and responses fully typed by default.
- :muscle: **Developer experience**: `@zimic/fetch` seeks to be as compatible with the
  [native Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) as possible, while providing an ergonomic
  interface to improve type safety. Define default options to apply to your requests, such as a base URL, headers,
  search parameters, and more. Inspect and modify requests and responses using
  [`onRequest`](/docs/fetch/api/fetch#onrequest) and [`onResponse`](/docs/fetch/api/fetch#onresponse) listeners.

### `@zimic/interceptor`

:::info Status: <span>**Beta** :seedling:</span>

:::

[`@zimic/interceptor`](/docs/interceptor) provides a flexible and type-safe way to intercept and mock HTTP requests.

- :globe_with_meridians: **HTTP interceptors**: Intercept HTTP requests and return mock responses. Use
  [local](/docs/interceptor/guides/local-interceptors) or [remote](/docs/interceptor/guides/remote-interceptors)
  interceptors to adapt your mocks to your development and testing workflow.
- :zap: **Fully typed mocks**: Use your [`@zimic/http` schema](/docs/http/guides/schemas) and create type-safe mocks for
  your HTTP requests.
- :link: **Network-level interceptor**: `@zimic/interceptor` combines [MSW](https://github.com/mswjs/msw) and
  [interceptor servers](/docs/interceptor/cli/server) to handle real HTTP requests. From you application's point of
  view, the mocked responses are indistinguishable from the real ones.
- :wrench: **Flexibility**: Mock external services and reliably test how your application behaves. Simulate success,
  loading, and error states with ease using [standard web APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API).
- :bulb: **Simplicity**: `@zimic/interceptor` was designed to encourage clarity, simplicity, and robustness in your
  mocks.

:::tip TIP: <span>`@zimic/fetch` and `@zimic/interceptor` work best together</span>

`@zimic/fetch` and `@zimic/interceptor` are designed to work together, providing a seamless and type-safe experience for
performing HTTP requests and mocking them during development and testing.

However, it's perfectly possible to use `@zimic/interceptor` with any HTTP client implementation, such as
[axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios). Similarly, `@zimic/fetch` can be used with any interceptor library, like
[msw](https://www.npmjs.com/package/msw).
