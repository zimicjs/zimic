# Testing

`@zimic/interceptor` is designed with testing in mind and provides utilities to give you confidence in your tests. Using
[declarative assertions](/docs/zimic-interceptor/guides/7-declarative-assertions.md), you can write your expectations in
a readable way that makes it clear how many requests the application should make, what parameters they should have, and
what responses they will receive. If you need more specific assertions, the requests processed by the interceptor are
available in [`handler.requests`](/docs/zimic-interceptor/api/3-http-request-handler.md#handlerrequests).

## Configuration

Configuring `@zimic/interceptor` in a testing environment usually depends on your
[method of intercepting requests](/docs/zimic-interceptor/2-getting-started.mdx#creating-an-http-interceptor) and how
you are applying your mocks.

### Interceptor lifecycle

`@zimic/interceptor` interceptors need to be started before they can intercept requests. You can start an interceptor by
calling [`interceptor.start()`](/docs/zimic-interceptor/api/2-http-interceptor.md#interceptorstart).

When an interceptor is running, you can declare mocks with
[`interceptor.<method>()`](/docs/zimic-interceptor/api/2-http-interceptor.md#declaring-request-handlers), where
`<method>` is an HTTP method. To make sure that your tests do not affect each other, it's a good practice to clear the
interceptor between tests with
[`interceptor.clear()`](/docs/zimic-interceptor/api/2-http-interceptor.md#interceptorclear).

After each test, you can check that all expected requests were made with
[`interceptor.checkTimes()`](/docs/zimic-interceptor/api/2-http-interceptor.md#interceptorchecktimes). This method will
throw an error if the number of requests or their parameters do not match the expectations you set with
[`handler.with()`](/docs/zimic-interceptor/api/3-http-request-handler.md#handlerwith) and
[`handler.times()`](/docs/zimic-interceptor/api/3-http-request-handler.md#handlertimes).

After all tests are done, stop the interceptor with
[`interceptor.stop()`](/docs/zimic-interceptor/api/2-http-interceptor.md#interceptorstop).

A common way to manage this lifecycle is to have a test setup file with hooks such as `beforeAll`, `beforeEach`,
`afterEach`, and `afterAll`. The specific implementation may vary depending on your test framework.

As an example, this is a simple setup using [Jest](https://jestjs.io) or [Vitest](https://vitest.dev):

<Tabs groupId="zimic-http-interceptor-type">
  <TabItem value="local" label="Local interceptor">

```ts title='tests/setup.ts'
beforeAll(async () => {
  // Start intercepting requests
  // highlight-next-line
  await interceptor.start();
});

beforeEach(() => {
  // Clear interceptors so that no tests affect each other
  // highlight-next-line
  interceptor.clear();
});

afterEach(() => {
  // Check that all expected requests were made
  // highlight-next-line
  interceptor.checkTimes();
});

afterAll(async () => {
  // Stop intercepting requests
  // highlight-next-line
  await interceptor.stop();
});
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="remote" label="Remote interceptor">

```ts title='tests/setup.ts'
beforeAll(async () => {
  // Start intercepting requests
  // highlight-next-line
  await interceptor.start();
});

beforeEach(() => {
  // Clear interceptors so that no tests affect each other
  // highlight-next-line
  await interceptor.clear();
});

afterEach(() => {
  // Check that all expected requests were made
  // highlight-next-line
  await interceptor.checkTimes();
});

afterAll(async () => {
  // Stop intercepting requests
  // highlight-next-line
  await interceptor.stop();
});
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::info INFO: <span>Remote interceptors are asynchronous</span>

Note that [`interceptor.clear()`](/docs/zimic-interceptor/api/2-http-interceptor.md#interceptorclear) and
[`interceptor.checkTimes()`](/docs/zimic-interceptor/api/2-http-interceptor.md#interceptorchecktimes) are awaited in the
remote interceptor example, whereas this is not necessary for local interceptors.

This is because many operations in [remote interceptors](/docs/zimic-interceptor/guides/2-remote-http-interceptors.md)
are asynchronous because they may involve communication with an
[interceptor server](/docs/zimic-interceptor/cli/1-server.md). This is different from
[local interceptors](/docs/zimic-interceptor/guides/1-local-http-interceptors.md), which have mostly synchronous
operations.

### Managing concurrency

Running tests in parallel may cause your interceptors to start interfering with each other and result in flaky tests.
How to avoid this depends on the type of interceptor you are using.

#### Local interceptors

With [local interceptors](/docs/zimic-interceptor/guides/1-local-http-interceptors.md), racing conditions between test
workers are unlikely, because each interceptor affects only the thread it was created in (hence, the name _local_).

However, running more than one test at the same time in the same thread **can** lead to concurrency problems.
`@zimic/interceptor` does not currently support this, so we recommend avoiding concurrent features like
[`test.concurrent`](https://vitest.dev/api/#test-concurrent).

Instead, consider splitting your tests into smaller files. By doing this, your test framework can run them in parallel
in separate threads, each with their own interceptors and without racing conditions.

#### Remote interceptors

[Remote interceptors](/docs/zimic-interceptor/guides/2-remote-http-interceptors.md) use an
[interceptor server](/docs/zimic-interceptor/cli/1-server.md) to handle requests. They are especially useful when your
application and your test runner run in _separate_ processes, such as in end-to-end tests. If you are sharing the same
interceptor server between multiple parallel test workers, you may run into racing conditions. In this case, some
solutions include:

1. **Using a [path discriminator](/docs/zimic-interceptor/api/2-http-interceptor.md#path-discriminators)**:

   This is a way to make sure that each test worker uses a different path in the interceptor server, usually a worker
   index or identifier. In this strategy, each worker can declare its own mocks without risk of interfering with the
   others. Make sure that the application also uses the same path discriminator when making requests, so that they are
   handled by the correct interceptor. See this in practice in our
   [Playwright example](https://github.com/zimicjs/zimic/tree/main/examples/zimic-with-playwright#readme).

2. **Applying default mocks before your tests start**:

   In this approach, you can start your interceptor server and run a script that populates a set of default mocks. When
   your tests start, the mocks will already be loaded and no racing conditions will occur. This is demonstrated in our
   [Next.js App Router example](https://github.com/zimicjs/zimic/tree/main/examples/zimic-with-next-js-app#readme). It's
   important that individual tests do not create new mocks that may override the default ones and affect others.
   Instead, declare the default mocks in such a way that they can be reused by all tests, such as with
   [computed restrictions](/docs/zimic-interceptor/api/3-http-request-handler.md#computed-restrictions) and
   [computed responses](/docs/zimic-interceptor/api/3-http-request-handler.md#computed-responses).
