# `HttpRequestHandler`

An HTTP request handler to declare responses for intercepted requests. When multiple handlers of the same interceptor
match the same method and path, the _last_ handler created with
[`interceptor.<method>(path)`](/docs/zimic-interceptor/api/2-http-interceptor.mdx#declaring-request-handlers) will be
used.

:::tip TIP: <span>Awaiting remote `HttpRequestHandler` operations</span>

If you are using a remote interceptor, make sure to `await` the handler before making requests. This is because many
remote handler operations are asynchronous and require communication with the
[interceptor server](/docs/zimic-interceptor/cli/1-server.md).

If you don't await the handler, your declarations may not be committed to the server before the requests are made,
leading to non-deterministic behavior. A single `await` is enough, even if you are making multiple declarations, as
`HttpRequestHandler` automatically batches all changes.

```ts
// Instead of awaiting each operation separately:
const handler = interceptor.patch('/users/:userId');
await handler.with((request) => /^\d+$/.test(request.pathParams.userId));
await handler.with({ body: { username: 'new-username' } });
await handler.respond({ status: 204 });
await handler.times(1);

// You can await the handler once:
const handler = await interceptor
  .patch('/users/:userId')
  .with((request) => /^\d+$/.test(request.pathParams.userId))
  .with({ body: { username: 'new-username' } })
  .respond({ status: 204 })
  .times(1);
```

When using a local interceptor, you can safely skip awaiting the handler, as all operations are synchronous and
immediate.

:::

## `handler.method`

The method that matches this handler.

**Type**: `HttpMethod` (readonly)

## `handler.path`

The path that matches this handler. The base URL of the interceptor is not included, but it is used when matching
requests.

**Type**: `string` (readonly)

## `handler.with()`

Declares a restriction to intercepted request matches. `headers`, `searchParams`, and `body` are supported to limit
which requests will match the handler and receive the mock response. If multiple restrictions are declared, either in a
single object or with multiple calls to `handler.with()`, all of them must be met, essentially creating an AND
condition.

By default, restrictions use `exact: false`, meaning that any request **containing** the declared restrictions will
match the handler, regardless of having more properties or values. If you want to match only requests with the exact
values declared, use `exact: true`.

<Tabs groupId="zimic-http-interceptor-type">
  <TabItem value="local" label="Local interceptor">

```ts
handler.with(restriction);
handler.with((request) => matchesRequest);
```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="remote" label="Remote interceptor">

```ts
await handler.with(restriction);
await handler.with((request) => matchesRequest);
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

**Arguments**:

1. **restriction**: `HttpRequestHandlerRestriction<Schema, Method, Path>`

   The restriction to match intercepted requests. It can be
   [static](/docs/zimic-interceptor/guides/http/7-declarative-assertions.mdx#static-restrictions), defined as an object
   with the following properties:
   - **headers**: `HttpRequestHandlerHeadersStaticRestriction<Schema, Method, Path> | undefined`

     A set of headers that the intercepted request must contain to match the handler. If exact is `true`, the request
     must contain exactly these headers and no others.

   - **searchParams**: `HttpRequestHandlerSearchParamsStaticRestriction<Schema, Method, Path> | undefined`

     A set of search params that the intercepted request must contain to match the handler. If exact is `true`, the
     request must contain exactly these search params and no others.

   - **body**: `HttpRequestHandlerBodyStaticRestriction<Schema, Method, Path> | undefined`

     The body that the intercepted request must contain to match the handler. If exact is `true`, the request must
     contain exactly this body and no other.

   - **exact**: `boolean | undefined` (default: `false`)

     If `true`, the request must contain **exactly** the headers, search params, and body declared in this restriction.
     Otherwise, the request must contain **at least** them.

   Restrictions can also be
   [computed](/docs/zimic-interceptor/guides/http/7-declarative-assertions.mdx#computed-restrictions), declared as a
   function to dynamically decide how to check the request:

   **Arguments**:
   1. **request**: `HttpInterceptorRequest<Path, MethodSchema>`

      The intercepted request to check against the restriction.

   **Returns**: `Promise<boolean> | boolean`

   A boolean indicating whether the intercepted request matches the restriction.

**Returns**: `HttpRequestHandler<Method, Path, StatusCode>`

The same handler, now considering the specified restriction.

If the interceptor is local, the restriction is immediately applied to the handler. If the interceptor is remote, the
restriction is asynchronously sent to the [interceptor server](/docs/zimic-interceptor/cli/1-server.md). Because of the
asynchronous nature of remote interceptors, make sure to await the handler before making requests.

## `handler.delay()`

Declares a delay to wait before responding to requests. This is useful for simulating network latency, server processing
time, or testing loading states in your application, for example.

<Tabs groupId="zimic-http-interceptor-type">
  <TabItem value="local" label="Local interceptor">

```ts
handler.delay(milliseconds);
handler.delay(minMilliseconds, maxMilliseconds);
handler.delay((request) => milliseconds);
```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="remote" label="Remote interceptor">

```ts
await handler.delay(milliseconds);
await handler.delay(minMilliseconds, maxMilliseconds);
await handler.delay((request) => milliseconds);
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

**Arguments**:

1. **milliseconds**: `number | HttpRequestHandlerResponseDelayFactory<Path, MethodSchema>`

   The delay to apply before responding, in milliseconds. It can be either:
   - An exact number for static delays, or;
   - A function that returns the delay, which can be useful to generate dynamic delays based on the request.

2. **maxMilliseconds** (optional): `number`

   If two arguments are provided, the first is considered the minimum delay and the second the maximum delay, both in
   milliseconds. Each response will have a random delay within this range, calculated using
   [`Math.random()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/random).

**Returns**: `HttpRequestHandler<Method, Path, StatusCode>`

The same handler, now including the configured delay.

**Related**:

- [Declarative delays](/docs/zimic-interceptor/guides/http/8-declarative-delays.mdx)

## `handler.respond()`

Declares a response to return for matched intercepted requests.

When the handler matches a request, it will respond with the given declaration. The response type is statically
validated against the schema of the interceptor.

<Tabs groupId="zimic-http-interceptor-type">
  <TabItem value="local" label="Local interceptor">

```ts
handler.respond(declaration);
handler.respond((request) => declaration);
```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="remote" label="Remote interceptor">

```ts
await handler.respond(declaration);
await handler.respond((request) => declaration);
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

**Arguments**:

1. **declaration**:
   `HttpRequestHandlerResponseDeclaration<MethodSchema, StatusCode> | HttpRequestHandlerResponseDeclarationFactory<MethodSchema, StatusCode>`

   The response declaration or a factory to create it. It can be a static object:
   - **status**: `HttpStatusCode`

     The status code for the response.

   - **headers**: `HttpHeadersInit<HeadersSchema> | undefined`

     The headers to include in the response.

   - **body**: `HttpBody`

     The body to include in the response.

   A declaration can also be a function to dynamically decide how to respond to the request:

   **Arguments**:
   1. **request**: `HttpInterceptorRequest<Path, MethodSchema>`

      The intercepted request to respond to.

   **Returns**:
   `Promise<HttpRequestHandlerResponseDeclaration<MethodSchema, StatusCode>> | HttpRequestHandlerResponseDeclaration<MethodSchema, StatusCode>`

**Returns**: `HttpRequestHandler<Method, Path, StatusCode>`

The same handler, now including type information about the response declaration based on the status code.

If the interceptor is local, the response is immediately applied to the handler. If the interceptor is remote, the
response is asynchronously sent to the [interceptor server](/docs/zimic-interceptor/cli/1-server.md). Because of the
asynchronous nature of remote interceptors, make sure to await the handler before making requests.

## `handler.times()`

Declares a number of intercepted requests that the handler will be able to match and return its response.

If only one argument is provided, the handler will match exactly that number of requests. In case of two arguments, the
handler will consider an inclusive range, matching at least the minimum (first argument) and at most the maximum (second
argument) number of requests.

Once the handler receives more requests than the maximum number declared, it will stop matching requests and returning
its response. In this case, Zimic will try other handlers until one eligible is found; otherwise the request will be
either bypassed or rejected.

<Tabs groupId="zimic-http-interceptor-type">
  <TabItem value="local" label="Local interceptor">

```ts
handler.times(numberOfRequests);
handler.times(minNumberOfRequests, maxNumberOfRequests);
```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="remote" label="Remote interceptor">

```ts
await handler.times(numberOfRequests);
await handler.times(minNumberOfRequests, maxNumberOfRequests);
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

**Arguments**:

1. **numberOfRequests**: `number`

   If only one argument is provided, this is the exact number of requests to match. If two arguments are provided, this
   is considered a minimum.

2. **maxNumberOfRequests**: `number | undefined`

   If two arguments are provided, this is the maximum number of requests to match.

**Returns**: `HttpRequestHandler<Method, Path, StatusCode>`

The same handler, now considering the specified number of requests.

:::info IMPORTANT: <span>Checking the number of requests</span>

To make sure that all expected requests were made, use
[`interceptor.checkTimes()`](/docs/zimic-interceptor/api/2-http-interceptor.mdx#interceptorchecktimes) or
[`handler.checkTimes()`](#handlerchecktimes).
[`interceptor.checkTimes()`](/docs/zimic-interceptor/api/2-http-interceptor.mdx#interceptorchecktimes) is generally
preferred, as it checks all handlers created by the interceptor with a single call.

:::

**Related**:

- [Declarative assertions](/docs/zimic-interceptor/guides/http/7-declarative-assertions.mdx#number-of-requests)

## `handler.checkTimes()`

Checks if the handler has matched the expected number of requests declared with [`handler.times()`](#handlertimes).

If the handler has matched fewer or more requests than expected, this method will throw a `TimesCheckError` error
pointing to the [`handler.times()` API reference](#handlertimes) that was not satisfied.

This is useful at the end of a test to ensure that all expected requests were made. If you are calling
[`interceptor.checkTimes()`](/docs/zimic-interceptor/api/2-http-interceptor.mdx#interceptorchecktimes) after each test,
you can skip this call, as it will be called automatically for all handlers created by the interceptor.

When [`requestSaving.enabled`](/docs/zimic-interceptor/api/2-http-interceptor.mdx#interceptorrequestsaving) is `true` in
your interceptor, the `TimesCheckError` errors will also list each unmatched request with diff of the expected and
received data. This is useful for debugging requests that did not match a handler with
[`handler.with` restrictions](#handlerwith).

<Tabs groupId="zimic-http-interceptor-type">
  <TabItem value="local" label="Local interceptor">

```ts
handler.checkTimes();
```

**Returns**: `void`

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="remote" label="Remote interceptor">

```ts
await handler.checkTimes();
```

**Returns**: `Promise<void>`

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## `handler.clear()`

Clears any response declared with [`handler.respond()`](#handlerrespond), restrictions declared with
[`handler.with()`](#handlerwith), and intercepted requests, making the handler stop matching requests. The next handler,
created before this one, that matches the same method and path will be used if present. If not, the requests of the
method and path will not be intercepted.

To make the handler match requests again, register a new response with [`handler.respond()`](#handlerrespond).

<Tabs groupId="zimic-http-interceptor-type">
  <TabItem value="local" label="Local interceptor">

```ts
handler.clear();
```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="remote" label="Remote interceptor">

```ts
await handler.clear();
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

**Returns**: `HttpRequestHandler<Method, Path, StatusCode>`

The same handler, now cleared of any response, restrictions, and intercepted requests.

## `handler.requests`

The intercepted requests that matched this handler, along with the responses returned to each of them. This is useful to
allow additional validation in tests, if you are not using
[declarative assertions](/docs/zimic-interceptor/guides/http/7-declarative-assertions.mdx) or you need more advanced
checks.

**Type**: `InterceptedHttpInterceptorRequest<Path, MethodSchema, StatusCode>[]`

:::info IMPORTANT: <span>`handler.requests` requires request saving to be enabled</span>

This method can only be used if
[`requestSaving.enabled`](/docs/zimic-interceptor/api/2-http-interceptor.mdx#interceptorrequestsaving) is `true` in the
interceptor.
