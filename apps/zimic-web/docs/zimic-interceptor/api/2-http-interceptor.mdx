# `HttpInterceptor`

HTTP interceptors provide the main API to handle HTTP requests and return mock responses. The methods, paths, status
codes, parameters, and responses are statically-typed based on the service schema.

Each interceptor represents a service and can be used to mock its paths and methods.
