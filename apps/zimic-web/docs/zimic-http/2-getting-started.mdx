# Getting started

This guide will help you get started with `@zimic/http`.

## Requirements

### Supported environments

#### Client side

`@zimic/http` is designed to work in any environment that supports the
[Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API). This includes any relatively modern browser.
[Can I Use](https://caniuse.com/?search=fetch) is a great resource to check the compatibility of specific features with
different browsers.

#### Server side

| Runtime                       | Version   |
| ----------------------------- | --------- |
| [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) | >= 18.0.0 |

### Supported languages

#### TypeScript

`@zimic/http` requires [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) >= 4.8. If you plan on using
[`zimic-http typegen`](/docs/http/cli/typegen), we recommend at least TypeScript 5.0.

We recommend enabling `strict` in your `tsconfig.json`:

```json title='tsconfig.json'
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    // highlight-next-line
    "strict": true
  }
}
```

#### JavaScript

`@zimic/http` is fully functional on JavaScript, although the type features will be disabled. Consider using TypeScript
for improved type safety and developer experience.

## Installation

`@zimic/http` is available as a library on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@zimic/http).

```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn" label="yarn">

```bash

We also have canary releases under the tag `canary`. These have the latest code, including new features, bug fixes, and
possibly unstable or breaking changes.

## Your first HTTP schema

### Declaring an HTTP schema

To start using `@zimic/http`, create an [HTTP schema](/docs/zimic-http/guides/1-http-schemas.md).

The schema represents the structure of your API, including the paths, methods, request and response types.

:::tip TIP: <span>OpenAPI Typegen</span>

For APIs with an [OpenAPI documentation](https://www.openapis.org) (e.g. [Swagger](https://swagger.io)), the
[`zimic-http typegen`](/docs/zimic-http/guides/3-typegen.md) CLI can automatically infer the types and generate the
schema for you. This is a great way to keep your schema is up to date and save time on manual type definitions.

:::

```ts title='schema.ts'
import { type HttpSchema } from '@zimic/http';

interface User {
  username: string;
}

interface RequestError {
  code: string;
  message: string;
}

type Schema = HttpSchema<{
  '/users': {
    POST: {
      request: { body: User };
      response: {
        201: { body: User };
        400: { body: RequestError };
        409: { body: RequestError };
      };
    };

    GET: {
      request: {
        headers: { authorization: string };
        searchParams: {
          query?: string;
          limit?: number;
        };
      };
      response: {
        200: { body: User[] };
        400: { body: RequestError };
        401: { body: RequestError };
      };
    };
  };

  '/users/:userId': {
    PATCH: {
      request: {
        headers: { authorization: string };
        body: Partial<User>;
      };
      response: {
        204: {};
        400: { body: RequestError };
      };
    };
  };
}>;
```

## Next steps

### Guides

Take a look at our [guides](/docs/http/guides) for more information on how to use `@zimic/http` in common scenarios.

### Examples

Try our [examples](/docs/zimic/2-examples/2-examples.md) for more practical use cases of `@zimic/http` with popular
libraries and frameworks.

### API reference

Visit the [API reference](/docs/http/api) for more details on the resources available in `@zimic/http`.

### Ecosystem

`@zimic/http` is a lightweight library that really shines when used with the rest of the ecosystem:

- [`@zimic/fetch`](/docs/zimic-fetch/1-index.md) is a minimal, zero-dependency, and type-safe `fetch`-like API client.
  Import your `@zimic/http` schema to automatically type your paths, methods, requests, parameters, and responses.

- [`@zimic/interceptor`](/docs/zimic-interceptor/1-index.md) provides a flexible and type-safe way to intercept and mock
  HTTP requests. Declare realistic HTTP mocks validated with your `@zimic/http` schema, and verify that your application
  interacts as expected, without needing to access the actual API.
