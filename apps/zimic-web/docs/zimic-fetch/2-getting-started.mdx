# Getting started

This guide will help you get started with `@zimic/fetch`.

## Requirements

### Supported environments

#### Client side

`@zimic/fetch` is designed to work in any environment that supports the
[Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API). This includes any relatively modern browser.
[Can I Use](https://caniuse.com/?search=fetch) is a great resource to check the compatibility of specific features with
different browsers.

#### Server side

| Runtime                       | Version   |
| ----------------------------- | --------- |
| [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) | >= 18.0.0 |

### Supported languages

#### TypeScript

`@zimic/fetch` requires [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) >= 5.0.

We recommend enabling `strict` in your `tsconfig.json`:

```json title='tsconfig.json'
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    // highlight-next-line
    "strict": true
  }
}
```

#### JavaScript

`@zimic/fetch` is fully functional on JavaScript, although the type features will be disabled. Consider using TypeScript
for improved type safety and developer experience.

## Installation

`@zimic/fetch` is available as a library on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@zimic/fetch).

  <TabItem value="npm" label="npm">

```bash
npm install @zimic/http @zimic/fetch --save

```bash
pnpm add @zimic/http @zimic/fetch
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn" label="yarn">

```bash
yarn add @zimic/http @zimic/fetch
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::info

Note that [`@zimic/http`](/docs/zimic-http/1-index.md) is a peer dependency of `@zimic/fetch`, so you need to install
both packages. When upgrading `@zimic/fetch` to a new version, consider upgrading `@zimic/http` as well to ensure that
the versions are compatible.

:::

We also have canary releases under the tag `canary`. These have the latest code, including new features, bug fixes, and
possibly unstable or breaking changes.

## Your first fetch instance

### Declaring an HTTP schema

To start using `@zimic/fetch`, declare an HTTP schema using [`@zimic/http`](/docs/zimic-http/guides/1-http-schemas.md):

The schema represents the structure of your API, including the paths, methods, request and response types.

:::tip TIP: <span>OpenAPI Typegen</span>

For APIs with an [OpenAPI documentation](https://www.openapis.org) (e.g. [Swagger](https://swagger.io)), the
[`zimic-http typegen`](/docs/zimic-http/guides/3-typegen.mdx) CLI can automatically infer the types and generate the
schema for you. This is a great way to keep your schema is up to date and save time on manual type definitions.

:::

```ts title='schema.ts'
import { type HttpSchema } from '@zimic/http';

interface User {
  username: string;
}

interface RequestError {
  code: string;
  message: string;
}

type Schema = HttpSchema<{
  '/users': {
    POST: {
      request: { body: User };
      response: {
        201: { body: User };
        400: { body: RequestError };
        409: { body: RequestError };
      };
    };

    GET: {
      request: {
        headers: { authorization: string };
        searchParams: {
          query?: string;
          limit?: number;
        };
      };
      response: {
        200: { body: User[] };
        400: { body: RequestError };
        401: { body: RequestError };
      };
    };
  };

  '/users/:userId': {
    PATCH: {
      request: {
        headers: { authorization: string };
        body: Partial<User>;
      };
      response: {
        204: {};
        400: { body: RequestError };
      };
    };
  };
}>;
```

### Creating a fetch instance

With the schema defined, you can now create a [fetch instance](/docs/zimic-fetch/api/2-fetch.md).

`@zimic/fetch` provides a [`createFetch`](/docs/zimic-fetch/api/1-create-fetch.md) function that takes the schema as a
type parameter and returns a thin wrapper around the native
[Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API). It adds type safety for making requests and handling
responses, all automatically typed based on the schema.

```ts
import { createFetch } from '@zimic/fetch';

const fetch = createFetch<Schema>({
  baseURL: 'http://localhost:3000',
});
```

Set the `baseURL` option to the base URL of your API. It will be prepended to all requests made with this instance.

You can also set other options, such as default headers, credentials, parameters, and more. Refer to the
[`createFetch` API reference](/docs/zimic-fetch/api/1-create-fetch.md) for more details.

### Making requests

You can now use the `fetch` instance to make requests to your API. All paths, methods, parameters, requests, and
responses are typed by default based on the schema.

```ts
const response = await fetch('/users', {
  method: 'GET',
  searchParams: { query: 'u', limit: 10 },
});

// If the user was not found, return null
if (response.status === 404) {
  return null;
}

// If the request status is 4XX or 5XX), throw an error
if (!response.ok) {
  throw response.error;
}

// If the request was ok, the data type is inferred as User[]
const users = await response.json();
return users;
```

## Next steps

### Guides

Take a look at our [guides](/docs/fetch/guides) for more information on how to use `@zimic/fetch` in common scenarios.

### Examples

Try our [examples](/docs/zimic/2-examples/index.md) for more practical use cases of `@zimic/fetch` with popular
libraries and frameworks.

### API reference

Visit the [API reference](/docs/fetch/api) for more details on the resources available in `@zimic/fetch`.

### Explore the ecosystem

- Access the [`@zimic/http`](/docs/zimic-http/1-index.md) documentation to learn more about extending your HTTP schema.

- If you are interested in mocking your requests in development and testing, check out
  [`@zimic/interceptor`](/docs/zimic-interceptor/1-index.md). Declare realistic HTTP mocks validated with the same
  schema as your fetch client, and verify that your application interacts as expected, without needing to access the
  actual API.
