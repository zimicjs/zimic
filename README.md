---

Zimic is a lightweight, thoroughly tested, TypeScript-first HTTP request mocking library, inspired by
[Zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod)'s type inference and using [MSW](https://github.com/mswjs/msw) under the hood.

## Features

Zimic provides a flexible and type-safe way to mock HTTP requests.

- :zap: **Statically-typed mocks**: Declare the
  [schema](https://github.com/zimicjs/zimic/wiki/api‐zimic‐interceptor‐http‐schemas) of your HTTP endpoints and create
  fully typed mocks.
- :link: **Network-level intercepts**: Internally, Zimic combines [MSW](https://github.com/mswjs/msw) and
  [interceptor servers](https://github.com/zimicjs/zimic/wiki/cli‐zimic‐server) to act on real HTTP requests. From you
  application's point of view, the mocked responses are indistinguishable from the real ones.
- :wrench: **Flexibility**: Mock external services and reliably test how your application behaves. Simulate success,
  loading, and error states with ease using [standard web APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API).
- :bulb: **Simplicity**: Zimic was designed to encourage clarity, simplicity, and robustness in your mocks. Check our
  [getting started guide](https://github.com/zimicjs/zimic/wiki/getting‐started) and starting mocking!

```ts
import { type JSONValue } from 'zimic';
import { type HttpSchema } from 'zimic/http';
import { httpInterceptor } from 'zimic/interceptor/http';

type User = JSONValue<{
  username: string;
}>;

// Declare your service schema
type MyServiceSchema = HttpSchema.Paths<{
  '/users': {
    GET: {
      response: {
        200: { body: User[] };
      };
    };
  };
}>;

// Create and start your interceptor
const myInterceptor = httpInterceptor.create<MyServiceSchema>({
  type: 'local',
  baseURL: 'http://localhost:3000',
});

await myInterceptor.start();

// Declare your mocks
const listHandler = myInterceptor.get('/users').respond({
  status: 200,
  body: [{ username: 'diego-aquino' }],
});

// Enjoy!
const response = await fetch('http://localhost:3000/users');
const users = await response.json();
console.log(users); // [{ username: 'diego-aquino' }]
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> Zimic has gone a long way in v0, but we're not yet v1!
>
> Reviews and improvements to the public API are possible, so breaking changes may **_exceptionally_** land without a
> major release during v0. Despite of that, we do not expect big mental model shifts. Usually, migrating to a new Zimic
> release requires minimal to no refactoring. During v0, we will follow these guidelines:
>
> - Breaking changes, if any, will be delivered in the next **_minor_** version.
> - Breaking changes, if any, will be documented in the [version release](https://github.com/zimicjs/zimic/releases),
>   along with a migration guide detailing the introduced changes and suggesting steps to migrate.
>
> From v0.8 onwards, we expect Zimic's public API to become more stable. If you'd like to share any feedback, please
> feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/zimicjs/zimic/issues) or
> [create a discussion](https://github.com/zimicjs/zimic/discussions/new/choose)!
